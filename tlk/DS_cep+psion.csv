A Half-giant is an enormous individual, standing between 10 to 12 feet tall, and weighing in the neighborhood of 1,600 pounds. Their features are human, but exaggerated."

Muls are usually the products of the slave pits. Their owners recognize the Muls assets as gladiators and laborers, and so order the births of as many muls as can be managed within the ranks of their slaves. Muls are born sterile- they can't reproduce their kind. A full-grown Mul, male or female,  stands 6 to 6 1/2 feet tall and weighs 240 to 300 pounds. They are fair skinned, sometimes tendings toward a copperish coloration and have no hair of any kind."
114,,,"Born as they are to lives of slave labor, with the taskmaster's whip taking place of parents and family, you are prone to having a gruff personality and vialent reactions. Understandably, you don't often seek friends or companionship as you've mostly lived your life in servitude, driven by hatred and spite. You, however, have learned who to trust in the slave pits and who not to, gaining favor and reputation among the other slaves. As Many slave Muls before you, you have plans to either escape or otherwise win your freedom and live an indepentent life on Athas."

An Athasian Elf stands between 6 1/2 and 7 1/2 feet tall. They are slender, lean, and generally in terrific physical condition. Thier features are deeply etched into their weather-toughened face, and their skin made rugged by the windblown sands and baking sun of the wilderness."
124,,,"Elves often take up adventuring out of wanderlust, but those that persist in adventuring generally do so out of desire for profit, glory, revenge, or out of loyalty to traveling companions who have won their friendship. You love to boast of your accomplishments or have your deeds woven into song, so you often hoard keepsakes from a memorable raids; you even quilt pieces of stolen clothing into your cloaks. Little pleases you as much as to flaunt a stolen item in front of its original owner. Elven custom dictates that the victim should acknowledge the accomplishment by congratulating the thief on his possession of such an attractive item. Those who fail to show you such gallantry are considered poor sports."

Halflings are muscled and proportioned like humans, but they have the faces of wise beautiful children.

A human female is somewhat smaller averaging between 5 1/2 to 6 feet in height and weighing between 100 and 140 pounds. The color of skin, eyes, and hair vary widely. On Athas, centuries of abusive magic have not only scarred the landscape, they've twisted the essence of human apperance as well. Thier facial features might be slightly bizarre, a large chin or nose, pointed ears, no facial hair, etc. Thier coloration might be subtly different, such as coppery or golden brown hues of grey or patchy skin. The differences may also be more physical, such as webbed toes or fingers, longer or shorter limbs, etc. "
139,,,"Humans in Athas are generally tolerant of other races. Being one, you can easily adapt to situations involving Elves or Dwarves, and even more exotic races such as the Half-giants and the Thri-kreen.

The language of the Pterrans is a collection of vocal sounds, which are combined with clicks and taps made with claws. As a result, other races on Athas find it hard to speak this language, so Pterrans often have to speak the common language albeit with a remarked accent."

36574,,,"The activation concept is simple, though there are many variations of these spring type engines. This particular design, known as the scorpion is characterized by the main launching, or striking, arm being bent back and held under tension. When the arm is released, it strikes and launches an arrow. This is a true direct-firing weapon in the sense that the fired projectile has a straight line trajectory. A crew of 4 is necessary for proper usage, giving a rate of fire of about one bolt every other minute. This particular engine is more anti-personnel than structure damaging."

36597,,,"The king is the most important and most vulnerable piece on the board. To lose one's king is to lose the game. The king may only move and capture one square at a time, though it may do so in any direction."
36598,,,"The ladder appears sturdy enough."
36599,,,"The latest in siege technology. The cannon provides long ranged and powerful attacks against fortified targets. However, this power comes at a cost - the gunpowder and high quality metalworking needed to make the cannon and ammunition do not come cheaply from the gnomish smiths who invented it."
36600,,,"The light penetrates only so far into the gloomy depths. From somewhere deep below, you hear something splash."
36601,,,"The lovely flowers brighten their environment."
36602,,,"The most effective machine that a besieging force can have for direct assault is the high wood tower. Assembled on wheels, it can lower a kind of drawbridge to give passage for the attackers who then are able to charge directly the top of the defended ramparts. The belfries are often made from green sapling trees, cut in the forests close to the besieged places, which reduces their vulnerability to fire. Being of solid build, the structure can support considerable loads - carrying a payload of 50 fighters is not unheard of."
36603,,,"The most versatile attacker on the board, the knight has a peculiar two and over movement style, and is the only piece (aside from the rook and king while castling) that can 'jump' over other pieces. This gives the knight great maneuverability. The knight must move two squares either horizontally or vertically, and then one perpendicular to its original move."
36604,,,"The mouthwatering smell of fresh-baked bread rises from this loaf."
36605,,,"The moveable siege ladder is one of a class of weapons used in offensive siege warfare. The siege ladder allows attacking soldiers to cross moats or other blockades around castle walls. The siege ladder also provides offensive armies with a method of gaining entrance to a castle without first knocking down the castle walls. This design has an extendable ladder, which can elevate. It is however not frequently used because of the difficulty involved in transporting the heavy and bulky vehicle over rough terrain."
36606,,,"The queen is the most powerful piece on the board, capable of unlimited movement in any direction. Despite this, the queen is as vulnerable as any other piece, and makes a prime target. Losing ones queen early can be crippling. The queen can move and capture in any direction."
36607,,,"The rook is the defender of the king. Although possessed of unlimited range, the rooks best ability is to 'castle', and make a simultaneous defensive move with its king, providing niether have already moved. The rook moves and captures horizontally only."

36661,,,"This is a counterweight trebuchet, where the long pivoted beam, has the short side pulled down by the weight of a hutch filled with grovel. This in turn, causing the long side to rise quickly. A sling attached to the end of the long side of the beam whips over, releases itself and hurls the projectile it held. Though these machines have many variants, (often a result of on-location assembly) The counterweight type all share the same basic outlay. This particular design requires about 4 individuals to operate and can hurl, 80Kg stones for a distance of about 100 meters. reload time in this machine is relatively slow, requiring several minutes to fire again."
36662,,,"This is a counterweight trebuchet, where the long pivoted beam, has the short side pulled down by the weight of a two hutches filled with gravel. This in turn, causing the long side to rise quickly. A sling attached to the end of the long side of the beam whips over, releases itself and hurls the projectile it held. The two smaller hutches permit easier transport and assembly, also giving excellent horizontal accuracy due to their superior balance. This particular design requires about 4 individuals to operate and can hurl, 80Kg stones for a distance of about 150 meters. It's rate of fire is five to six times higher than that of the  regular single hutch Trebuchet. In the world of counterweight trebuchets, this one can be considered as top dog."

36664,,,"This is a fine quality wooden table."
36665,,,"This is a heavy, wooden, roofed construction on wheels used to help protect attackers as they use their rams or try to dig under walls.

36670,,,"This is a simple lady's mirror."
36671,,,"This is a single arm, torsion-powered, stone-throwing engine. This machine has its throwing arm's lower end inserted into twisted sinew and is held in torsion. And the upper throwing end of the arm is installed with a sling, to add the angular momentum of the pouch to the forward thrust of the projectile. The rate of fire is about one shot per minute and a weight of 15Kg can be flung to a distance of 180 Meters with a crew of two."
36672,,,"This is a sticky pool of slime."
36673,,,"This is a strange looking table."
36674,,,"This is a traction trebuchet, or Perrier (rock thrower). The power is provided by muscle. The triangular spreader is used to facilitate several pulling ropes. This particular design has the triangle in a horizontal arrangement. The advantages of this design is that all the pullers' ropes are joined to the beam at the same height, so they all reach their maximum leverage and pull at the same moment of the launch -  giving a potential for a more explosive effort. The triangle also supports the axle, making it easier to build the axle assembly rigid. Movement here can have a large effect on the side-to-side accuracy of the machine. The major disadvantages are that the pullers all reach the point where their efforts have no effect (when their ropes are in line with the beam) at the same time, after which the beam is coasting. The engine has very fast reload time. With a crew of 3, This  particular machine can shoot several times a minute, projectiles of about 10Kg to a distance of about 50 meters. Also since this type has a single upright beam and is very small, construction is very fast and very easy."
36675,,,"This is a traction trebuchet, the power is mainly provided by muscle. The triangular spreader is used to facilitate several pulling ropes. This particular design has the triangle in a vertical arrangement and has an additional weight at the base of the triangle. Such hybrid machines, using both counterweights and manual pulling power are also called Bricole. The advantages of the vertical formation is that The pullers each reach their maximum and minimum efforts at slightly different times thus giving a more even and longer application of power. This allows the machine to throw heavier projectiles. The major disadvantage is that the pullers' maximum efforts and leverage cannot occur at the same time, losing   the explosive team burst of power. The engine has very fast reload time. With a crew of 8, This  particular machine can shoot several times a minute, projectiles of about 25Kg to a distance of about 200 meters."
36676,,,"This is a very flimsy structure."
36677,,,"This is an ominous looking doorway."
36678,,,"This is not truly a siege weapon but more of a weapon used in defense of a besieged keep or castle. This weapon consists of a large pot that is used to hold boiling oil or water or tar that is then poured down on top of the attackers attempting to force their way inside."
36679,,,"This ivy is growing luxuriantly."
36680,,,"This log looks like a comfortable place to sit."
36681,,,"This looks like a common house to you."
36682,,,"This machine of war is assembled on a mobile mounting which makes it possible to point the mechanism towards the objective with much precision. One then lays a long spear, several meters in length on the axis. The winch hastens reload time, and the added torsion of the ropes can hurl a projectile to more than 60 meters. This frightening machine is especially used against other machines of war."
36683,,,"This magical crystal emits light."
36684,,,"This metal grate serves as a door."
36685,,,"This mobile catapult design uses a bow to provide the stored tension needed for the firing mechanism. It is relatively easy to operate, and can deliver 15kg stone projectiles to a distance of about 250 meters with deadly precision. A crew of 3 is more than enough to provide a respectable firing rate of about 1 shot per minute."
36686,,,"This mobile ram consists of a long beam armed with an iron head at its end, suspended horizontally with cables or chains, and driven by means of cords fixed at the tail. The crew operating the arm is sheltered under a roof, which facilitates closer proximity to the besieged structure. The belier is mostly used to attack walls, though a gate would make an easier target."
36687,,,"This mobile ram consists of a long beam, suspended horizontally with cables or chains, and driven by means of a handle at the tail. It is unprotected, and the crew operating the arm is exposed to enemy archers. This makes approach to besieged structures a risky venture at best. Given it's drawbacks, this type is mostly used to attack gates, or wooden structures and is virtually useless against well built stone walls."

36700,,,"This seems like a serviceable tent."
36701,,,"This shabby looking outhouse is actually an entrance to a mine. A mine is used to damage walls. A tunnel is dug below the foundations of the castle wall. A large chamber is created underneath the foundations by excavating the soil; the wall above being temporarily supported by wooden props. Between these props the miners place combustible material. Once the chamber is deemed to be sufficiently large, the combustible material is set on fire and the miners withdraw. The supporting props eventually burn through and the wall collapses into the chamber. Once a mine is begun, the only defense against it is ounter-mining; i.e. the defenders dig their own tunnel hoping to break in to that of the besiegers and halt its construction or try to flood it. Of course, a good moat can prevent mining altogether."

36710,,,"This siege engine is a hybrid trebuchet, requiring both a counterweight and traction for activation. The mangonneau is an enormous machine which requires the presence of 12 artillerists and  a chief of operation. The lever is lowered using a winch operated  by two wheels, six people are necessary because the counterweight  weighs several tons. When the lever is lowered the pocket of the  sling can be armed with a large stone ball or even several stones. The chief of operation gives the signal, the lever is released and  a group of gunners are suspended on the cords and accelerate the  upswing of the sling. The aiming process is rather long and one  must often carry out many tests. This machine can launch a heavy  projectile of about 100Kg only every approximately two hours, but  as soon as the calibration is finished the damage caused to fortifications is considerable. The projectile can reach a distance  of up to 150 meters. The Rather complicated nature of the reloading mechanism and the  enormous counterweight, produce a great deal of stress on the  frame, this in turn, massively reduces the life span of the mechanism."

1st Round: Presence or absence of evil. 
2nd Round: Number of evil auras (creatures) in the area and the strength of the strongest evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, the strongest evil aura's strength is ""overwhelming"" (see below), and  the strength is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. While you are stunned, you can't act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers gain  +2 bonuses to attack you. 
3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. (Absolute position)
Aura Strength: An aura's evil power and strength depend on the type of evil creature that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level. "

Purists of the Flame seldom lock themselves up in a monastery, instead they seek to actively use their power for the good, or evil of the world. They often hold to their own standards instead of the standards of society. Another difference with monks is that gods seldom have any impact upon a Purist of the Flame, they do not often worship gods, and if they do it will most always be a god that holds a strong bond with the flames.
The Purists of the world vary greatly; from the rebel who strives to fight against tyranny to the cold hearted villain who uses his powers to oppress and exploit the people. However they all share a common goal towards perfection and respect of the inner flame.
