        a new one.\r\n2. Place or make sure the WalkWayPoints() is within the body
        of the On Spawn script for the creature.\r\n3. Place a series of waypoints
        along the route you wish the creature to walk.\r\n4. Select all of the newly
        created waypoints and right click. Choose the Create Set option.\r\n5. The
        waypoint set will have a set name of \"WP_\" + NPC Tag. Thus if an NPC with
        the Tag \"Guard\" will have a waypoint set called \"WP_Guard\". Note that
        Tags are case sensitive."}}
