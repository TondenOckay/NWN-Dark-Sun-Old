Summary:
HCR2 loot system script.

This script should be called via ExecuteScript from the
RunModuleEventScripts(H2_EVENT_ON_PLAYER_DYING, oPC) function that is called from h2_playerdying_e.

To make this script execute, a string variable, named OnPlayerDyingX
where X is a number that indicates the order in which you want this player dyingh script to execute,
should be assigned the value "h2_lootsystemopy" under the variables section of Module properties.
