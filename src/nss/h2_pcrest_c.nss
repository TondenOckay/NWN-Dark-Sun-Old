//Begin user configurable constant declarations.

//Minimum Time in real seconds that must pass since the last time a PC rested and
//recovered spells, feats and health, for them to recover them again when they rest.
//Recommended Equation: [Minutes per game hour] * 60 * 8; (results in 8 game hours)
//The default value is 960, which is 8 game hours using 2 RL minutes per game hour.
//To not require any minimum elapsed time set the value to 0.

//Amount of hit points per level that is healed when resting after the minimum time above passed.
//The default value is 1.
//To allow PCs to heal to maximum hitpoints, set the value to -1.
//Note that some with rest event hook-in scripts may alter the final amount of HP healed after the rest
//to a value different than what would result from the value you specify below, even if the value is -1.

//Set this value to true to create a blindness and snoring visual effect on PCs who
//rest with recovery.

//Set this to true to only allow resting inside designated trigger zones
//or within 4 meters of a campfire.

//The tag of the campfire placeable to be used.
